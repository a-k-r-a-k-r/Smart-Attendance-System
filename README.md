# Smart-Attendance-System  [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)
AI based system for attendance marking in colleges and schools (GUI) for simplifying the workload of teachers.


## Getting started
### Step 1: Clone the Repo to the local system using the below command
```
git clone https://github.com/a-k-r-a-k-r/Smart-Attendance-System.git
```

### Step 2: Install Python and pip (if it is not available in your system)
In order to run this script on your local system, you need to have Python and pip installed on your system. This code is for Windows based systems. You can modify it for using it on Linux based systems. 

### Step 3: Install requirements
Run the following command from your terminal to install the requirements from the same folder (directory) of the project.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the script
After satisfying all the requirements for the project, Open the terminal in the project folder and run
```
python attendance.py
```
or
```
python3 attendance.py
```
depending upon the python version. Make sure that you are running the command from the same virtual environment in which the required modules are installed.


### Step 5: Open camera
- Click on the Start Class Button 


### Step 6: To view the attendance after the class
- Click on Get Attendance button once the class is over
- Open the attendance.txt file in the directory
- Attendace can be viewed only after some time. Therefore wait for some time after clicking the Start Class button before clicking on the Get Attendance Button. Let the program decide, whether the students are really present in the class.

# Detailed Documentation will be updated soon. 
This program was developed as a class assignment. Therefore you can expect lots of bugs. Moreover the program is not optimized too.
